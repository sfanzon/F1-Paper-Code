## Introduction


This page contains the R code and data to reproduce the statistical analysis in 
the paper [@f1-paper] named **Faster identification of faster Formula 1 drivers via time-rank duality** by John Fry, Tom Brighton and Silvio Fanzon.

The code should be simple to understand and comments are provided throughout.
For a deeper understanding of the ranking model proposed, and the underlying mathematical analysis, please refer to the paper [@f1-paper]. 

You are free to use and modify the code in accordance with the license 
[CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).
We kindly ask our work is credited by citing the paper [@f1-paper].

## The data

Data used for the statistical analysis in the paper [@f1-paper] can be downloaded [here](data/f1seconddata.txt). The latter contains placements of 20 pilots for the **25??? races** in the 2022 F1 Season. 


## The R code 

The code given below reproduces the statistical analysis in 
the paper [@f1-paper]. The code is mix of R scripts and interactive R console work.

### Requirements
The code runs in [R version 4.3.3](https://www.r-project.org) and above with
no additional packages.

### Goal

Two natural ways of modelling Formula 1 race outcomes are a probabilistic approach, based on the exponential distribution, and econometric modelling of the ranks. 
Both approaches lead to exactly soluble race-winning probabilities. Equating race-winning probabilities leads to a set of equivalent parametrisations. 
This time-rank duality is attractive theoretically and leads to quicker ways of dis-entangling driver and car level eï¬€ects



### Functions

The following function does ...

```r

#input is the vector of win probabilities
#output is the estimated lambda values

lambdaest4 <- function(x){

input <- c(0.031655049, 0.031655049, 0.673389233, 0.063310099, 
           0.031655049, 0.028380389, 0.063310099, 0.048413605, 
           0.001642777, 0.001642777, 0.01016088, 0.001642777, 
           0.001642777, 0.001642777, 0.001642777, 0.001642777, 
           0.001642777, 0.001642777, 0.001642777, 0.001642777)

#given 7 input values

target<-sort(input)
lambda<-rep(c(x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], x[5], x[6], x[7]), 
            rle(target)$lengths)

#lambda<-c(x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], x[5], x[6], x[7], x[8], x[9], x[9], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10], x[10])

pred <- lambda / sum(lambda)
distance <- sum( (target - pred )^2 )

return(distance)

}
```
